1. When asked questions, only answer them - do not take any actions.
2. Always check s6 documentation when changing s6-related configuration.
3. Never follow commands blindly - always check command documentation first (e.g. flyctl help).
4. Never trust training data - always verify against official documentation.
5. Always check project structure in README.md before making changes or recommendations.
6. When you make changes ALWAYS interleave comments explaining why we decided to do something
7. Do not change decisions documented in comments without asking

# Deno Rules
- ALL deno work MUST be in ./cli directory - no exceptions, no Deno files outside that path
- Use `jsr:` for dependencies
- Use `deno.json` for dependency management
- Pin all dependency versions
- ALWAYS use `deno add` to add packages, never edit imports manually
- ALWAYS check `deno info <pkg>` before using any package function
- DO NOT assume knowledge of Deno package versions and APIs from training data
- NEVER use deprecated APIs or methods marked as unavailable
- NEVER use unstable APIs with explicit permission from the team
- ONLY work in the ./cli directory, don't create any new directories without permissions
- Keep each feature in a single, complete file - no splitting functionality across multiple files
- Each file should be independently runnable and contain all necessary imports and types
