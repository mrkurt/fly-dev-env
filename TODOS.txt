# System Migration TODOs

- Remove legacy s6 from test image
  - Currently seeing legacy s6 service warnings in test output
  - Should only use s6-overlay v3 services 

- Convert overlayfs-init to a Deno command
  - Currently a bash script in tests/image/overlayfs-init
  - Should be a TypeScript command in commands/overlayfs-init.ts
  - Will make it easier to maintain and test
  - Can reuse helper functions from other commands
